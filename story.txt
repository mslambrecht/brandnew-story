	This is the story of a mythical land full of wonder and magic.  Within this land lies a the kingdom of Liric, and within the kingdom a wizard apprentice starting his first day of the job.  

The apprentice walked up to the Wizard's hut and banged on the door. There was no answer, but when he turned around the Wizard was standing right behind him.
"You must be my new apprentice. Let's get started on your training." The Wizard took his new apprentice's hand and they were magically whisked away.

A few moments later they arrived at the peak of Himalayas. The wizad told apprentice that he wanted to see his talent. So after telling him the mantra he disappeared.
 It was so cold at peak that the apprentice was trembling in the wind. He tried to use the magic and mantra to return but nothing happened.

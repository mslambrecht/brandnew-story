	This is the story of a mythical land full of wonder and magic.  Within this land lies a the kingdom of Liric, and within the kingdom a wizard apprentice starting his first day of the job.  

The apprentice walked up to the Wizard's hut and banged on the door. There was no answer, but when he turned around the Wizard was standing right behind him.
"You must be my new apprentice. Let's get started on your training." The Wizard took his new apprentice's hand and they were magically whisked away.

A few moments later they arrived at the peak of Himalayas. The wizad told apprentice that he wanted to see his talent. So after telling him the mantra he disappeared.
 It was so cold at peak that the apprentice was trembling in the wind. He tried to use the magic and mantra to return but nothing happened.

"This job is the worst!" exclaimed the apprentice. "As soon as I get off this rock, I am suing that wizard for violating my worker's rights!" The wizard may be knowledgable in the magical arts, but is not well-versed in a court of law. No magic could protect him from laying down the long arm of the law.

Terribly cold, the apprentice starting running down the Himalayas with nothing to stop him. He was determined to find the best lawyer this land has to offer. Days, weeks, months went back. The apprentice was determined but then he took out his phone and Googled "Best lawyers on Earth" and found one. The lawyer listened to his story and told him he would take his case for a small price of $3120.20. Unforunately, he had no money but offered his wand, which the Lawyer gladly took as payment.
